  "introduction": "The luxury cruise ship Aurora Star glides through the Mediterranean under a blanket of stars. It's the final night of the seven-day voyage, and passengers are celebrating at the Captain's Farewell Gala in the Grand Ballroom. At 11:32 PM, during the height of the festivities, a blood-curdling scream pierces through the music. Moments later, the ship's famous celebrity chef, Marcus Beaumont, is found dead in the ship's cold storage freezer, apparently locked inside and frozen to death. With the ship still 12 hours from port and no way to contact authorities due to a mysterious communications blackout, you must uncover the truth before the killer strikes again or escapes when the ship docks.",
